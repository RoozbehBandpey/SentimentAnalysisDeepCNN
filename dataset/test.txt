1	10 great price for all the features
1	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs
0	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience
0	however , it has failed to deliver on quality
0	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens
1	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6
1	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use
0	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed
0	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing
1	the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent
0	first , the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does n't support a folder stucture
0	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display
0	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be
0	the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage
1	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features
0	only con i can think of is no camera
1	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
0	scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
1	equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for
1	i love all of the features , and presets as well
0	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it
1	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent
1	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone
0	the grain was terrible
1	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate
0	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price
1	overall this is a slightly better than average phone
1	the lcd screen was very large and readable
1	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated
0	what the hell is wrong with this thing
1	ability to play most discs i tried dvd , vcd , dvd r , audio cd and it played all
1	the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details
1	can 't beat carrying 500 cd collection with me wherever i go
1	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
0	it has never worked
1	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player
0	the software failed repeatedly
0	the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc
1	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images
0	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd
1	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
1	progressive scan player for a relatively low price \( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower priced progressive scan players as well \)
1	all in all suprisingly easy to use
1	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable
1	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement
1	not only is it the perfect size \( not too small , not too large \) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want
0	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance \( less than 2 ft \)
1	8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white correction settings \( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out \) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets
1	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range
1	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior
1	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic \?
0	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well
0	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming
1	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order
1	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box
1	the powershot g3 is a great camera
1	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia 3650 and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make
0	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice
0	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place
1	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price
1	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase
0	3 \) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
1	i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there
1	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise
1	removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for 1 3 years
1	extremely convenient
1	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy
1	it was no problem for me to use their software
0	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to
1	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria
0	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity
1	this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone
1	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some
0	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work
0	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times
0	it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time
1	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !
1	because this camera is beautiful
0	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues
0	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line
1	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
1	very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has
1	the quality is superb
0	transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 1 or 2 0
1	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price
1	for the price and features it is really good
0	other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard 2 5 mm headset jack
0	controls are a bit awkward
1	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved
0	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop
1	i highly recommend this phone to anyone
1	it sure does !
1	great colors , pictures and white balance
1	player works and looks great if you can get the dvd 's to play
1	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s
1	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is
1	sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse , but its really good \( especially if your files have good sound quality \)
1	takes excellent photos
0	also , their t zones , although cheap \( 4 99 mo \) never works
1	this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket
1	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh , so light
0	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software
0	the interface used could be better designed
0	apex does n't answer the phone
1	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer
1	i bought the player this week and i like it by far
1	retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display
0	purchased the ad 2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it
1	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market
1	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options
1	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod
1	the in program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well
1	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
1	they take excellent macro shots as well
1	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome
0	on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside
0	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
0	flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost
0	one complaint the screen is too easily scratched !
1	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it
1	not counting the time i spent editing the songs \( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc \) the transfer was pretty painless
1	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use
1	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead
0	although the sound quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable mp 3 player to result in a good product
1	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4 5 megapixel
1	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3 4 of the screen and the image still looked normal
1	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always
1	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play
1	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use
0	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons
1	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun
0	my jpeg pictures are viewable \( not so sharp and vivid \) on my 27 screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 monitor
1	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
0	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd
1	on the up side , the phone has amazing battery life
0	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem
1	in general it is easy to use and well laid out
1	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand
0	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work
1	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try jog with it or something
0	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks
1	the prints are beautiful !
1	i love this camera
1	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry
1	i enthusiastically recommend this camera
1	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person
0	after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty
1	great screen and great sound
1	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit
0	2 the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select
1	oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet
1	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability
1	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box
0	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button
1	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption
1	while i would like to give it 3 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it
1	seriously ! i love it !
0	there was occasionally a lip sync issue \( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue \)
0	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order
1	i have no complaints with this mp3 player
0	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed
1	finding a particular song \( s \) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy
1	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you
1	3 \) user replaceable battery
1	have used it frequently and have had no problems
1	learning how to use it will not take very long
0	they play just about everything , but 2 and 3 died very shortly after getting them
0	one still works fine , the other quit after one day
1	the picturers are amazing
1	uploading music is quick and easy
