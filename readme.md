Sentiment Analysis of amazon product reviews with deep convolutional neural network.
The main focus of this work is a model that initializes the parameter weights of the convolutional neural network, which is effective to train an accurate model even for a small data-set. In a nutshell, we use a model to train initial word embeddings that are further tuned by our deep learning model. At a final stage, the pre-trained parameters of the network are used to initialize the model. Later on we compared this model with a baseline model, which takes randomly initialized word vectors as input.
